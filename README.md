# Northwestern Research Computing Python Workshops

This repository contains materials for Python workshops taught by [Research
Computing Services](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/).

All Python files are written using Python 3.6.  We recommend the Anaconda
distribution of Python ([download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)), which
includes many packages used by the scripts above, as well as Jupyter for running
notebooks.

You can preview Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts by clicking on the files
above. To download, click on the file, then click the raw button, and then save
the file. Or download the whole repository: see the green Clone or Download
button above.  (Cloning uses git; if you don't know git, just download the
repository as a .zip file.)

Some workshop materials are Python scripts (.py files) instead of Jupyter
notebooks.  We recommend the [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
Python IDE for editing and running Python scripts.  Free [Student
licenses](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) are available for academic use.

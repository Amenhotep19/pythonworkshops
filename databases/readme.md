# Databases

This workshop uses PostgreSQL.  Much of the material applies generically to SQL and other relational database systems, but some of it is specific to PostgreSQL.

## Resources

[PostgreSQL Tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/): this is the official tutorial

[PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/): interactive, online exercises to practice SQL skills in a PostgreSQL environment.  

[SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/): from SQL Zoo.  Not specific to PostgreSQL.  Also has interactive exercises. 

### SQLite

The workshop uses the PostgreSQL database system, but if you're working on your own projects, [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) may be a good option.  SQLite doesn't require running a server and it creates a database in a single, portable file locally on your computer.

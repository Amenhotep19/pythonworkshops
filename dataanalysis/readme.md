# Python for Data Analysis Workshop

The materials here include ([NumPy](numpy/readme.md), [pandas](pandas/readme.md), and [models](models/readme.md)), usually covered in separate sessions during in-person workshops.  Each part has lecture notes that the instructor will work from as well as exercise files (or links), both with and without answers (you'll learn more if you don't cheat!).  

The [visualization](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pythonvisualization) workshop materials that were here have been split off into a separate repository.

The lecture notes are meant for reference.  The instructor may deviate from them during the workshop, and will cover topics that may not be included there.

## Resources

These are general resources covering multiple data analysis topics.  Resources specific to each area are included in the 4 parts.

[Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook): The entire book as Jupyter Notebooks.  It does not provide an Introduction to Python.  It covers a similar set of materials to the Data Analysis workshop materials here.

[Data Science Your Way](https://github.com/jadianes/data-science-your-way): GitHub repository with lots of tutorials using Python and R

[Scientific Computing with Python](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures): series of lectures as notebooks.  Covering Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and advanced topics like C and Fortran integration and using Python for parallel computing.  

[SciPy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/index.html): NumPy, matplotlib, and SciPy math operations

[edX Python for Data Analysis course](https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-science-uc-san-diegox-dse200x): full online course, with certificate option

### Examples

Lots of people post examples of their work publicly.  Here are a few:

[Pandas and Seaborn example](https://gist.github.com/5agado/ee95008f25730d04bfd0eedd5c36f0ee)

[Classifier Example](https://gist.github.com/rspeer/ef750e7e407e04894cb3b78a82d66aed): uses lots of the tools we cover in this workshop, plus some additional ones.  Also a great example of things that can go wrong with machine learning, and how to avoid some issues with classifiers: "How to make a racist AI without really trying"

[Chris Albon's Notes](https://chrisalbon.com/): these started as notes for himself, but have grown into a good reference for data analysis tasks

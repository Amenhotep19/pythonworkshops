# Visualization

The [pandas](../pandas/readme.md) section covers plotting pandas data frames directly, but sometimes you need to go beyond the defaults, especially to make publication-quality graphics.

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is the core data visualization library in Python.

pandas plotting is built on [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), as are additional visualization libraries like [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).  For R users, there's a version of [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/) for Python too.  There are [specialty toolkits](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/mpl_toolkits/index.html) that build on matplotlib for tasks like geospatial visualization, but many require extra software installations, so we don't use them here.

[Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) is for interactive visualizations, as is [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/).

There are [other packages](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries/) too.

## Exercises

Github user guipsamora has created an excellent repository of pandas exercises for various skill levels, starting from the very basics:

[Pandas Exercises](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pandas_exercises)

Start with the [first set of exercises](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pandas_exercises/tree/master/01_Getting_%26_Knowing_Your_Data/Chipotle) and once you have completed those, pick a set that interests you.  

These exercises were forked from https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises.  If you see issues with the solutions or think something is wrong or could be improved, please [let us know](mailto:m-rich@northwestern.edu) so we can improve them for the next workshop.  We've revised the Chipotle exercises, but there are lots of exercises there that we haven't reviewed yet in detail.

# Python for Data Analysis

---

# Outline

---

## Part 1: <br>How to work with your data

NumPy (**_Num_**eric **_Py_**thon)

Pandas (**_pan_**el **_da_**ta)

---

## Part 2: <br>Creating things with your data

Visualization: matplotlib, Seaborn, others

Models and further analysis: scikit-learn, SciPy 

---

# Environment

---

## Jupyter notebooks
good for interactive analysis, presentation, sharing

&nbsp;

## PyCharm/other IDEs
for writing scripts that run without your intervention 

---

## Other Details

Python 3 (3.6)

# Your Workflow

How does Python fit into your workflow?

How do these packages fit in with Python?

---

## When to use Python

---

* You're working with others using Python
* You need to use existing code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Lots of data processing before analysis <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Address pain points or gaps in other programs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* It's what you're most familiar with <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Ease of use > speed/optimization <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

## When to use NumPy, pandas

---

NumPy and pandas are (generally) for working with data sets *in memory*

What's a reasonable size is relative to your computer

---

NumPy provides lower level operations on arrays

Arrays can be multi-dimensional, but can only have one type of data (usually numeric)

---

NumPy doesn't have a concept of a data set

---

## What do we mean by <br>data set?

&bull; multiple observations with values/measures on the same set of *named* dimensions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

&bull; different dimensions may have different types of data <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

pandas is built on NumPy 

pandas adds nice features for working with data sets<br>
(grouping, merging, time series, handling missing values, easy plotting)

Especially *well-structured* data sets 

---

## What do we mean by <br>well-structured?

(see also: [*tidy data*](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html))

---

Rows are observations (often with a name or label)

Columns are named measures/variables/dimensions

Data is in (possibly multiple) rectangular tables


---

## scikit-learn

Machine learning models

&nbsp;

## SciPy

Math and statistics

---

# Downloading from GitHub

---

## Why are we using GitHub?

* Version control
* Collaboration
* File previews
* It's where code lives online

---

GitHub shows a preview

You need to download the Raw source

# Python for Data Analysis

---

# Outline

---

## Part 1: How to work with your data

NumPy (**Num**eric **Py**thon)

Pandas (**pan**el **da**ta)

---

## Part 2: Creating things with your data

Visualization: matplotlib, Seaborn, others

Models/Analysis 

---

# Environment

Jupyter notebooks: good for interactive analysis, presentation, sharing

PyCharm/other IDEs: for writing scripts that run without your intervention 

---

# Other Details

Python 3 (3.6)

# Your Workflow

How does Python fit into your workflow?

How do these packages fit in with Python?

---

# When to use Python

* You're working with others using Python
* You need to use existing code
* Lots of data processing before analysis
* Address pain points or gaps in other programs 
* It's what you're most familiar with
* Speed is not top priority


---

# When to use NumPy, pandas

NumPy and pandas are (generally) for working with data sets *in memory*: work with reasonably sized data sets or subsets of them

---

NumPy provides lower level operations

---

NumPy doesn't have a concept of a data set 
(multiple observations with the same set of values/measures on named dimensions; different dimensions may have different types of data)

---

pandas is built on NumPy to add nice features (grouping, merging, time series, handling missing values) for working with *well-structured* data sets 

---

# What do you mean by well-structured?

---

Rows are observations (often with a name or label)

Columns are named measures or variables

Data is in (possibly multiple) rectangular tables

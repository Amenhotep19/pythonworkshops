# Python for Data Analysis

---

# Outline

---

## Part 1: How to work with your data

NumPy (**_Num_**eric **_Py_**thon)

Pandas (**_pan_**el **_da_**ta)

---

## Part 2: Creating things with your data

Visualization: matplotlib, Seaborn, others

Models and further analysis 

---

# Environment

---

## Jupyter notebooks
good for interactive analysis, presentation, sharing

## PyCharm/other IDEs
For writing scripts that run without your intervention 

---

## Other Details

Python 3 (3.6)



---

# Your Workflow

How does Python fit into your workflow?

How do these packages fit in with Python?

---

## When to use Python

---

* You're working with others using Python
* You need to use existing code |
* Lots of data processing before analysis |
* Address pain points or gaps in other programs |
* It's what you're most familiar with |
* Speed is not top priority |


---

## When to use NumPy, pandas

---

NumPy and pandas are (generally) for working with data sets *in memory*

*Reasonably-sized is relative to your computer*

---

NumPy provides lower level operations on arrays

Arrays can be multi-dimensional, but can only have one type of data (usually numeric)

---

NumPy doesn't have a concept of a data set:
* multiple observations with values/measures on the same set of named dimensions
* different dimensions may have different types of data

---

pandas is built on NumPy to add nice features 
(grouping, merging, time series, handling missing values, easy plotting) 
for working with *well-structured* data sets 

---

## What do you mean by well-structured?

---

Rows are observations (often with a name or label)

Columns are named measures or variables

Data is in (possibly multiple) rectangular tables


---

## scikit-learn

Machine learning models

## SciPy

Math and statistics

# Downloading from GitHub

---

## Why are we using GitHub?

* Version control
* Collaboration
* File previews
* It's where code lives online

---

GitHub shows a preview

You need to download the Raw source

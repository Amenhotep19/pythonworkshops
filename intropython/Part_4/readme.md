**If you download files from the links above, you have to click through to the RAW version of the notebook and download that.  If you download from the links above, the files won't open because they are web pages, not the raw files.**


## Downloading Exercises

To download exercise files, right-click on the links *below*, and choose Save Link As (or the similar option in your browser).  

For this part of the workshop, it's recommended that you try to write scripts in PyCharm or another IDE instead of using Jupyter notebooks, at least for some of the exercises.

Because there are a number of input and answer files, you may want to download the whole repository and then reference files from there, rather than trying to download all of the individual files.

Right-click to save: [Exercises without Answers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuitrcs/pythonworkshops/master/intropython/Part_4/Part_4_exercises.ipynb): try these first; you may also need to download some of the files from `exercise_input_files`.   

Right-click to save: [Exercises WITH Answers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuitrcs/pythonworkshops/master/intropython/Part_4/Part_4_exercises_with_answers.ipynb): note that this file references a lot of answer files from the directory `exercise_answer_files`, but you don't have to necessarily download those files to view them from the notebook

## Downloading Exercises

To download exercise files, right-click on the links *below*, and choose Save Link As (or the similar option in your browser). 

Because there are a number of input and answer files, you may want to download the whole repository and then reference files from there, rather than trying to download all of the individual files.

Right-click to save: [Exercises without Answers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuitrcs/pythonworkshops/master/intropython/Part_3/Python3-Exercises only.ipynb): try these first; you may also need to download some of the files from `exercise_input_files`.   

Right-click to save: [Exercises WITH Answers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuitrcs/pythonworkshops/master/intropython/Part_3/Python3.ipynb): note that this file references a lot of answer files from the directory `exercise_answer_files`, but you don't have to necessarily download those files to view them from the notebook
